{"name":"Alf Reference Implementation","tagline":"An open-source implementation of the OMG Action Language for fUML (Alf) specification.","body":"### Current Release\r\n[Version 0.6.0](https://github.com/ModelDriven/Alf-Reference-Implementation/releases), conforms to [Alf 1.0.1](http://www.omg.org/spec/ALF/1.0.1)\r\n\r\n### What is Alf?\r\n\r\nAlf is a textual language for representing [Unified Modeling Language (UML)](http://www.uml.org) models. It was developed with the primary purpose of acting as the notation for specifying executable behaviors within an overall graphical UML model. However, it also provides an extended notation for structural modeling. This makes it possible to represent complete, executable models using Alf.\r\n\r\nLike UML, Alf is standardized by the [Object Management Group (OMG)](http://www.omg.org), which maintains the [Alf specification](http://www.omg.org/spec/Alf). The underlying semantics of Alf are provided by the [Foundational UML (fUML)](http://www.omg.org/spec/FUML), which provides precise execution semantics for a subset of UML. Alf notation covers this fUML subset, which includes the typical structural modeling constructs of UML (classes, associations, data types and enumerations), as well as behavioral modeling using UML activities composed from a rich set of primitive actions.\r\n\r\n### What is the Alf Reference Implementation?\r\n\r\nThe Alf Reference Implementation is a complete, open source implementation of the Alf language. It compiles Alf source text to fUML. The compilation can target either of two fUML execution engine implementations:\r\n\r\n* The [fUML Reference Implementation](http://fuml.modeldriven.org) execution engine\r\n* The fUML execution engine from the [Moka framework](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Papyrus/UserGuide/ModelExecution) for model execution in the Eclipse Papyrus tool.\r\n\r\nThe implementation handles the full Alf syntax at the Extended compliance level, as given in Annex C (*Consolidated LL Grammar*) of the [Alf Specification](http://www.omg.org/spec/ALF/Current).\r\n\r\nStatic semantic checking is directly based on validating the constraints defined in Part III of the [Alf Specification](http://www.omg.org/spec/ALF/Current). However, as errors were discovered in these definitions, or inconsistencies with the descriptions in Part II were identified, these were corrected in the implementation. All such issues have either been corrected in the latest version of the specification or have been reported to the Alf Revision Task Force for correction in a future version.\r\n\r\n### Further Information\r\n\r\nFor further information, see the [Alf Reference Implementation Wiki](https://github.com/ModelDriven/Alf-Reference-Implementation/wiki).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
