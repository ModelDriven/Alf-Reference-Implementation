     * Loop Node
     * 
     * 1. A do statement maps to a loop node with isTestedFirst=false. The loop
     * node contains the activity nodes and edges mapped from both the block and
     * the condition expression of the do statement. All the actions from the
     * mapping of the condition expression constitute the test part of the loop
     * node. All the actions from the mapping of the block form the body part.
     * 
     * 2. If the result source element from the mapping of the condition
     * expression is an output pin, then this is the decider pin for the loop
     * node. Otherwise, a structured activity node is added inside the loop node
     * as follows: The structured activity node has one input pin and one output
     * pin, with an object flow from the input pin to the output pin contained
     * within the structured activity node. There is an object flow from the
     * result source element from the mapping of the expression to the input pin
     * of the structured activity node. The output pin of the structured
     * activity node is then used as the decider pin. Loop Variables
     * 
     * 3. Any name that is assigned in the condition expression or block of the
     * do statement is mapped to a loop variable of the loop node. The loop
     * variable corresponding to a name is used as the assigned source before
     * the block when mapping the do statement. If the name is assigned before
     * the do statement, then the corresponding loop variable input pin is the
     * target of an incoming object flow from the assigned source for the name
     * before the do statement. Otherwise the loop variable input pin is
     * unconnected.
     
       [Actually, names that are assigned before the loop need to have
       corresponding loop variables, even it they are NOT assigned within the
       while statement. This is to allow the incoming value of the name to be
       accessed in all iterations of the loop. Otherwise, the token with value
       for the name will be consumed on the first iteration.]       
     
     * 4. If the assigned source for the name after the condition expression of
     * the do statement is an output pin, then this output pin is identified as
     * the body output pin corresponding to the loop variable for the name.
     * Otherwise, a structured activity node is added to the mapping of the body
     * of the loop as follows: The structured activity node has one input pin
     * and one output pin, with an object flow from the input pin to the output
     * pin contained within the structured activity node. There is an object
     * flow from the assigned source for the name after the block to the input
     * pin of the structured activity node. The output pin of the structured
     * activity node is then used as the body output pin corresponding to the
     * name.
     * 
     * 5. If the assigned source of a name after a do statement is the
     * statement, then the source for its assigned value is the result output
     * pin of the loop node corresponding to the loop variable for the name.
     
       [Actually, the loop node result output pins need to have object flows to
       fork nodes, and the fork nodes are the sources for assigned values.]
