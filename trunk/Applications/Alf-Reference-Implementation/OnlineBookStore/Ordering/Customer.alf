/**
A customer is an individual or organization that has placed orders for books
and other products offered by the store.

A customer must have purchased products; a user who simply browses to the site
is not considered a customer until he or she places an order.

Customers remain active for six months after their last order. An active
customer receives periodic e-mail reminders of sales and can be eligible for
discounts based on how much he or she has previously purchased.
