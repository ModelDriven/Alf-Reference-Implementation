<p>
Alf is an action language for UML developed in response to the OMG <em>Concrete 
Syntax for a UML Action Language</em> Request for Proposals. The Alf specification 
document can be found at
<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/ALF">http://www.omg.org/spec/ALF</a>.
(See also 
<a href="http://www.omg.org/issues/alf-rtf.open.html">http://www.omg.org/issues/alf-rtf.open.html</a>
for the list of open issues currently being addressed by the Alf Revision
Task Force.)
<p>
This implementation is based on the Alf 1.0.1 specification.  It uses 
the fUML Reference Implementation execution engine 
(see <a href="http://fuml.modeldriven.org">http://fuml.modeldriven.org</a>), 
which implements fUML 1.1. (The version of the fUML Reference Implementation
used includes some additional issue corrections beyond the latest released 
version 1.1.0.)

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Download <tt>alf.zip</tt> from
<p>
<a href="http://lib.modeldriven.org/MDLibrary/trunk/Applications/Alf-Reference-Implementation/dist/">
http://lib.modeldriven.org/MDLibrary/trunk/Applications/Alf-Reference-Implementation/dist/</a>
<p>
This archive unzips into the installation directory for Alf. This directory
includes a Unix (BASH) shell script and a DOS batch file for running Alf. By
default, the <tt>Libraries</tt> subdirectory is expected to be in the same directory as
the scripts. If you move it, set the environment variable ALF_LIB to its path.
<p>
The file <tt>alf-src.zip</tt> unzips into two Eclipse projects that, together,
include the full source of the implementation.

<ul>
<li><tt>org.modeldriven.alf</tt> - This is the base project, including the
Alf parser, static semantic checking and generic mapping to fUML. However,
it is not dependent on any specific fUML implementation.</li>
<li><tt>org.modeldriven.alf.fuml.impl</tt> - This project extends the base
project to specialize the mapping to target the fUML Reference Implementation
and to allow compiled Alf text to be executed. It does not depend on the
fUML Reference Implementation project directly but, rather, uses an exported
fuml.jar file.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you wish to track updates to the implementation between releases, read-only
access to the Subversion repository for the source projects is available at

</a>

<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<p>
This implementation handles the full Alf syntax at the Extended compliance 
level, as given in Annex C <em>Consolidated LL Grammar</em> of the Alf 
Specification.
<p>
Static semantic checking is directly based on validating the constraints
defined in Part III of the Alf Specification. However, as errors were
discovered in these definitions, or inconsistencies with the descriptions in
Part II were identified, these were corrected in the implementation. All such
issues have either been corrected in the latest version of the specification 
or have been reported to the Alf Revision Task Force for correction in a future 
version.

<h3>Version 0.4.0</h4>
NOTE: If statements without else clauses are not allowed to defined new local 
names within their clauses. This has now been implemented per the specification,
which may result in ifStatementAssignmentsAfter constraint violations that did
not occur in previous versions.
<ul>
<li>Moved code specific to mapping to the fUML Reference Implementation into a
separate project, to avoid including it in implementations of other mappings.</li>
<li>Extensively updated and corrected the handling of external elements, as
required for integration with other UML tooling.</li>
<li>Corrected the parsing of stereotype annotations with tagged values.</li>
<li>Corrected errors in the handling of a unit importing internal elements,
template binding, local name assignments and other static semantic constraint 
checking.</li>
<li>Corrected the resolution of a constructor name that is the class name, to
only search <em>owned</em> members of the class.</li>
<li>Changed the resolution of association ends so that only end type conformance
is required, not type equality.</li>
<li>Updated mappings to target fUML 1.1 and corrected a number of mapping bugs.</li>
<li>Implemented return statements without expressions.</li>
<li>Updated the mapping for classify statements, so that, if any new classes are
active, their classifier behaviors are started. (See OMG Issue 18281.)</li>
<li>Completed the implementation of all "in place" behaviors in 
CollectionFunctions.alf.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.3.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Refactored to more easily accommodate integration with other tooling.</li>
<li>Corrected acceptStatementSignals constraint check to include inherited
receptions.</li>
<li>Updated classpath to use fuml.jar to build project, rather than depending on
the fUML-Reference-Implementation project.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.2.0</h3>
<ul>
<li>Implemented the proper handling of cyclic imports.</li>
<li>Corrected errors in the mapping of loop statements, accept statements and
classifier behaviors.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 0.1.0</h3>
The following Alf features are NOT currently implemented:
<ul>
<li>Profile and stereotype application (other than application of the standard 
stereotypes ModelLibrary, Create and Destroy)</li>
<li>Overloading resolution</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unit Resolution</h2>
<p>
Since this implementation is not embedded in a UML tool, Alf units are managed
as files. During the static semantic analysis of a unit, if an element of
another unit is referenced, then that unit is parsed into memory on demand from
the file corresponding to the unit in order to continue the checking of the
original unit.
<p>
Each Alf unit is expected to be contained in a single file, and each such file
must contain exactly one Alf unit. The files are contained in a directory
structure based on the qualified names of the units.
<p>
The <em>library directory</em> contains Alf unit definitions for the fUML
Foundational Model Library and the Alf Standard Model Library. These units
should not be moved from the library directory structure or changed. By default, 
the library directory is the <tt>Libraries</tt> subdirectory of the installation 
directory, but this may be changed using a command line option or by setting the 
ALF_LIB environment variable.
<p>
For example, with the default location for the library directory, the standard 
package <tt>Alf::Library::PrimitiveBehaviors</tt> is found in
the file 
<p>
<tt>Libraries/Alf/Library/PrimitiveBehaviors.alf</tt>
<p>
Subunits of <tt>PrimitiveBehaviors</tt> are then found in the corresponding 
subdirectory
<p>
<tt>Libraries/Alf/Library/PrimitiveBehaviors</tt>
<p>
Note that the <em>file</em> <tt>PrimitiveBehaviors.alf</tt> contains the Alf 
definition for the <tt>PrimitiveBehaviors</tt> package, while the 
<em>subdirectory</em> <tt>PrimitiveBehaviors</tt> groups the files for subunits 
of that package (i.e., <tt>BooleanFunctions.alf</tt>, 
<tt>IntegerFunctions.alf</tt>, etc.).
<p>
All user unit files corresponding to a single "user model" should be placed in
a similarly structured <em>model directory</em>. By default, the model directory
is the <tt>Models</tt> subdirectory of the installation directory, but this
may be overridden using a command line option.
<p>
For example, with the default location for the model directory, a unit with the 
qualified name
<p>
<tt>'Property Management'::'Data Model'::Properties::Property</tt>
<p>
is expected to be found in the file
<p>
<tt>Models/Property Management/Data Model/Properties/Property.alf</tt>
<p>
<em>Note that all characters in an unrestricted name (but not the surrounding 
quote characters) are currently carried over to the file path without change. 
Thus, characters that cannot be supported in file names must be avoided in unit
names.</em>
<p>
All namespace declarations are currently expected to resolve to Alf units.
Therefore, only units without namespace declarations are considered to be model
units. The model scope for such units is all the model units within the same
model directory (i.e., "in the same model"). Thus, one model unit may refer to 
another model unit located in the same model directory, without the need for
explicitly importing the other unit. References to any other elements of another
unit requires an import from the other unit (which is done implicitly for
units from the Alf library). Note, however, that any elements imported
into a unit are also available to all subunits without those subunits having to
also import them.

<h2>Unit Execution</h2>
<p>
To be executable, a unit must be the definition of either an activity with no 
parameters or a non-abstract active class with a classifier behavior. 
Execution of such a unit proceeds as follows:

<ol>

<li>The specified unit is parsed into an abstract syntax representation in
memory. Since units cannot currently be "pre-compiled", any units imported by 
the specified unit are also, recursively, parsed into memory. <em>(Note: This
means that the entire content of the library directory are parsed and loaded on
each execution.)</em> If there is a syntax error, this is reported and processing
ends.</li>

<li>All parsed units are checked for violations of the abstract syntax
constraints defined in the Alf specification. If there are any constraint
violations, they are reported and processing ends. Constraint violation messages 
take the form 
<br><br>
<tt><em>constraintName</em> in <em>fileName</em> at line <em>m</em>, column <em>n</em></tt>
<br><br>
The <tt><em>constraintName</em></tt> is the name of the violated constraint, as given in
the Alf specification. <em>(Note 1: Some constraints have additional conditions
implemented over what is currently given in the specification. Note 2: If the
fileName has a suffix of the form <tt>&lt;...&gt;</tt>, then the constraint
violation happened in a template instantiation. This should only happen if the
error actually exists in the template being instantiated.)</em></li>

<li>All parsed units are mapped to the in-memory representation used by the
fUML Reference Implementation. <em>(Note: If a mapping error occurs, processing
ends. However, if there are no constrain violations, mapping should always
succeed, so a mapping failure indicates an implementation error.)</em></li>

<li>An execution environment is created at a fUML locus, and the unit mapping is
executed in this environment. The console is used for standard input and output.
Execution tracing is at the specified debug level, to the console and the 
file <tt>alf.log</tt> (unless this configuration is changed in 
<tt>log4j.properties</tt>).</li>

</ol>

<h2>Command Line Script</h2>
<p>
A model can be executed from the command line using the <tt>alf</tt> shell 
script (for Unix) or the <tt>alf.bat</tt> batch file (for Windows/DOS). Usage is
<p>
<tt>alf [<em>options</em>] <em>unitName</em></tt>
<p>
where <tt><em>unitName</em></tt> is the fully qualified name of a unit to be executed.
The allowable <tt><em>options</em></tt> are
<p>
<tt>-d <em>level</em></tt>
<br>
Sets the debug level for trace output from the fUML execution engine. Useful
levels are:
<ul>
<li><tt>OFF</tt> turns off trace output.</li>
<li><tt>ERROR</tt> reports only serious errors (such as when a primitive
behavior implementation cannot be found during execution).</li>
<li><tt>INFO</tt> outputs basic trace information on the execution of activities
and actions.</li>
<li><tt>DEBUG</tt> outputs detailed trace information on activity execution.</li>
</ul>
The default is as configured in the <tt>log4j.properties</tt> file in the
installation directory.
<p>
<tt>-f</tt>
<br>
Treat the <tt><em>unitName</em></tt> as a file name, rather than as a qualified
name. The named file is expected to be found directly in the model directory
and the unit must have the same name as the file name (with any <tt>.alf</tt>
extension removed).  
<p>
<tt>-l <em>path</em></tt>
<br>
Sets the library directory location to <tt><em>path</em></tt>. If this option is not
given and the ALF_LIB environment variable is set, then the value of ALF_LIB is 
used as the library directory location. Otherwise, the default of <tt>Libraries</tt>
is used.
<p>
<tt>-m <em>path</em></tt>
<br>
Sets the model directory location to <tt><em>path</em></tt>. Qualified name resolution to
unit file paths is relative to the root of the model directory. If this option
is not given, the default of <tt>Models</tt> is used.
<p>
<tt>-p</tt>
<br>
Parse and constraint check the identified unit, but do not execute it. This is
useful for syntactic and static semantic validation of units that are not
executable by themselves.
<p>
<tt>-P</tt>
<br>
Parse and constraint check, as for the <tt>-p</tt> option, and then print out the
resulting abstract syntax tree. Note that the print out will occur even if there
are constraint violations.
<p>
<tt>-v</tt>
<br>
Sets verbose mode, in which status messages are printed about parsing and other
processing steps leading up to execution.

<h2>Sample Code</h2>
<p>
The installation <tt>Models</tt> directory contains a "Hello World" activity.
Zip archives with more extensive samples can be downladed from
<p>
<a href="http://lib.modeldriven.org/MDLibrary/trunk/Applications/Alf-Reference-Implementation/dist/">
http://lib.modeldriven.org/MDLibrary/trunk/Applications/Alf-Reference-Implementation/dist/</a>
<p>
These samples are described further below.
<h3>Hello World</h3>
<p>
The <tt>Models</tt> directory included in the installation archive contains an
Alf "Hello World" activity. To run this, use the command
<p>
<tt>alf Hello</tt>
<p>
from the installation directory.
<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>
The archive <tt>tests-x.zip</tt> unzips into a directory containing a set of simple 
execution tests. These can be run with a command of the following form
<p>
<tt>alf -m tests-x <em>testUnitName</em></tt>
<p>
Replace <tt>tests-x</tt> with the complete path to the directory, as
necessary. To run with trace output, use either the <tt>-d INFO</tt> or 
<tt>-d DEBUG</tt> option.
<p>
Note that the <tt><em>testUnitName</em></tt> is the same as the file
name, but without the <tt>.alf</tt> extension. I.e., the file 
<tt>Expressions_Assignment.alf</tt> contains the unit named
<tt>Expressions_Assignment</tt>. However, the units <tt>AssertTrue</tt>, 
<tt>AssertFalse</tt>, <tt>AssertList</tt> and <tt>Write</tt> are helper
activities, not tests, and are not individually executable.
<h3>Property Management Example</h3>
<p>
The archive <tt>PropertyManagementExample.zip</tt> unzips into a directory
containing a complete Alf implementation of the Property Management example from
Annex B.3 of the Alf specification. This example defines a service, rather than
an application. However, the activity Test sends one of each of the service
request, printing out the results. To run this activity, use the command
<p>
<tt>alf -m PropertyManagementExample Test</tt>
<p>
Replace <tt>PropertyMangementExample</tt> with the complete path to the model
directory, as necessary.  (This should be run without trace output, 
so use the <tt>-d OFF</tt> option if the debug level default has been 
changed from <tt>OFF</tt>.)
<h3>Online Bookstore</h3>
<p>
The archive <tt>OnlineBookstore.zip</tt> unzips into a directory containing a
complete Alf implementation of the Online Bookstore example from Appendix B
of the book <em>Executable UML</em> by Stephen Mellor and Marc Balcer. It also
includes a simple graphical user interface for customer interaction. By default,
the inventory consists of a single book (the <em>Executable UML</em> book,
actually). To run the application, use the command
<p>
<tt>alf -m OnlineBookstore Main</tt>
<p>
Replace <tt>OnlineBookstore</tt> with the complete path to the model directory,
as necessary. (This should be run without trace output, so use the <tt>-d OFF</tt>
option if the debug level default has been changed from <tt>OFF</tt>.)
