<h1>Action Language for UML (Alf) Open Source Implementation<br>
Version 0.1.0</h1>
<em>Copyright &copy; 2011, 2012 Data Access Technologies, Inc. (Model Driven Solutions)</em>
<p>
Alf is an action language for UML developed in response to the OMG <em>Concrete 
Syntax for a UML Action Language</em> Request for Proposals. The current
version of the Alf specification document can be found at
<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/ALF/Current">http://www.omg.org/spec/ALF/Current</a>.
<p>
This implementation is based on the Alf 1.0 Beta 1 specification but corrects a number
of issues that are currently being addressed by the Alf 1.0 Finalization Task
Force at OMG. (For the current list of formally submitted issues, see
<a href="http://www.omg.org/issues/alf-ftf.html">http://www.omg.org/issues/alf-ftf.html</a>.)
It uses the head revision of the fUML Reference Implementation execution 
engine (see <a href="http://fuml.modeldriven.org">http://fuml.modeldriven.org</a>), 
which is the released version 1.0.1, with some additional updates (to be included
in v1.0.2).

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Download <tt>alf.zip</tt> from
<p>
<a href="http://lib.modeldriven.org/MDLibrary/trunk/Applications/Alf-Reference-Implementation/dist/">
http://lib.modeldriven.org/MDLibrary/trunk/Applications/Alf-Reference-Implementation/dist/</a>.
<p>
This archive unzips into the installation directory for Alf. This directory
includes a Unix (BASH) shell script and a DOS batch file for running Alf. By
default, the <tt>Libraries</tt> subdirectory is expected to be in the same directory as
the scripts. If you move it, set the environment variable ALF_LIB to its path.
<p>
The file <tt>alf-src.zip</tt> unzips into an Eclipse project the includes the
full source of the implementation. However, the project requires the head
revision of the fUML Reference Implementation source project in order to build.

<h2>Release Notes</h2>
<p>
This implementation handles the full Alf syntax at the Extended compliance 
level, as given in the <em>Consolidated LL Grammar</em> annex to the Alf 
Specification.
<p>
Static semantic checking is directly based on validating the constraints
defined in Part III of the Alf Specification. However, as errors were
discovered in these definitions, or inconsistencies with the descriptions in
Part II were identified, these were corrected in the implementation. All such
issues are being reported to the Alf Finalization Task Force for correction in
the final specification.
<p>
The following Alf features are NOT currently implemented:
<ul>
<li>Profile and stereotype application (other than application of the standard 
stereotypes ModelLibrary, Create and Destroy)</li>
<li>Overloading resolution</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unit Resolution</h2>
<p>
Since this implementation is not embedded in a UML tool, Alf units are managed
as files. During the static semantic analysis of a unit, if an element of
another unit is referenced, then that unit is parsed into memory on demand from
the file corresponding to the unit in order to continue the checking of the
original unit.
<p>
Each Alf unit is expected to be contained in a single file, and each such file
must contain exactly one Alf unit. The files are contained in a directory
structure based on the qualified names of the units.
<p>
The <em>library directory</em> contains Alf unit definitions for the fUML
Foundational Model Library and the Alf Standard Model Library. These units
should not be moved from the library directory structured or changed. By default, 
the library directory is the <tt>Libraries</tt> subdirectory of the installation 
directory, but this may be changed using a command line option or by setting the 
ALF_LIB environment variable.
<p>
For example, with the default location for the library directory, the standard 
package <tt>Alf::Library::PrimitiveBehaviors</tt> is found in
the file 
<p>
<tt>Libraries/Alf/Library/PrimitiveBehaviors.alf</tt>
<p>
Subunits of <tt>PrimitiveBehaviors</tt> are then found in the corresponding 
subdirectory
<p>
<tt>Libraries/Alf/Library/PrimitiveBehaviors</tt>
<p>
Note that the <em>file</em> <tt>PrimitiveBehaviors.alf</tt> contains the Alf 
definition for the <tt>PrimitiveBehaviors</tt> package, while the 
<em>subdirectory</em> <tt>PrimitiveBehaviors</tt> groups the files for subunits 
of that package (i.e., <tt>BooleanFunctions.alf</tt>, 
<tt>IntegerFunctions.alf</tt>, etc.).
<p>
All user unit files corresponding to a single "user model" should be placed in
a similarly structured <em>model directory</em>. By default, the model directory
is the <tt>Models</tt> subdirectory of the installation directory, but this
may be overridden using a command line option.
<p>
For example, with the default location for the model directory, a unit with the 
qualified name
<p>
<tt>'Property Management'::'Data Model'::Properties::Property</tt>
<p>
is expected to be found in the file
<p>
<tt>Models/Property Management/Data Model/Properties/Property.alf</tt>
<p>
<em>Note that all characters in an unrestricted name (but not the surrounding 
quote characters) are currently carried over to the file path without change. 
Thus, characters that cannot be supported in file names must be avoided in unit
names.</em>
<p>
All namespace declarations are currently expected to resolve to Alf units.
Therefore, only units without namespace declarations are considered to be model
units. However, the effective "model scope" for such units is empty. References
from one unit to elements of another unit always requires an import from the
other unit (implicitly or explicitly). Note, however, that any elements imported
into a unit are also available to all subunits without those subunits having to
also import them.

<h2>Unit Execution</h2>
<p>
To be executable, a unit must be either the definition of an activity with no 
parameters or of a non-abstract active class with a classifier behavior. 
Execution of such a unit proceeds as follows:

<ol>

<li>The specified unit is parsed into an abstract syntax representation in
memory. Since units cannot currently be "pre-compiled", any units imported by 
the specified unit are also, recursively, parsed into memory. <em>(Note: This
means that the entire content of the library directory are parsed and loaded on
each execution.)</em> If there is a syntax error, this is reported and processing
ends.</li>

<li>All parsed units are checked for violations of the abstract syntax
constraints defined in the Alf specification. If there are any constraint
violations, they are reported and processing ends. Constraint violation messages 
take the form 
<br><br>
<tt><em>constraintName</em> in <em>fileName</em> at line <em>m</em>, column <em>n</em></tt>
<br><br>
The <tt><em>constraintName</em></tt> is the name of the violated constraint, as given in
the Alf specification. <em>(Note 1: Some constraints have additional conditions
implemented over what is currently given in the specification. Note 2: If the
fileName has a suffix of the form <tt>&lt;...&gt;</tt>, then the constraint
violation happened in a template instantiation. This should never happen, so,
if it does, it indicates an implementation error.)</em></li>

<li>All parsed units are mapped to the in-memory representation used by the
fUML Reference Implementation. <em>(Note: If a mapping error occurs, processing
ends. However, if there are no constrain violations, mapping should always
succeed, so a mapping failure indicates an implementation error.)</em></li>

<li>An execution environment is created at a fUML locus, and the unit mapping is
executed in this environment. The console is used for standard input and output.
Execution tracing is at the specified debug level, to the console and the 
file <tt>alf.log</tt> (unless this configuration is changed in 
<tt>log4j.properties</tt>).</li>

</ol>

<h2>Command Line Script</h2>
<p>
A model can be executed from the command line using the alf shell script (for
Unix) or the alf.bat batch file (for Windows/DOS). Usage is
<p>
<tt>alf [<em>options</em>] <em>unitName</em></tt>
<p>
where <tt><em>unitName</em></tt> is the fully qualified name of a unit to be executed.
The allowable <tt><em>options</em></tt> are
<p>
<tt>-d <em>level</em></tt>
<br>
Sets the debug level for trace output from the fUML execution engine. Useful
levels are:
<ul>
<li><tt>OFF</tt> turns off trace output.</li>
<li><tt>INFO</tt> outputs basic trace information on the execution of activities
and actions.</li>
<li><tt>DEBUG</tt> outputs detailed trace information on activity execution.</li>
</ul>
The default is as configured in the <tt>log4j.properties</tt> file in the
installation directory.
<p>
<tt>-f</tt>
<br>
Treat the <tt><em>unitName</em></tt> as a file name, rather than as a qualified
name. The named file is expected to be found directly in the model directory
and the unit must have the same name as the file name (with any <tt>.alf</tt>
extension removed).  
<p>
<tt>-l <em>path</em></tt>
<br>
Sets the library directory location to <tt><em>path</em></tt>. If this option is not
given and the ALF_LIB environment variable is set, then the value of ALF_LIB is 
used as the library directory location. Otherwise, the default of <tt>Libraries</tt>
is used.
<p>
<tt>-m <em>path</em></tt>
<br>
Sets the model directory location to <tt><em>path</em></tt>. Qualified name resolution to
unit file paths is relative to the root of the model directory. If this option
is not given, the default of <tt>Models</tt> is used.
<p>
<tt>-p</tt>
<br>
Parse and constraint check the identified unit, but do not execute it. This is
useful for syntactic and static semantic validation of units that are not
executable by themselves.
<p>
<tt>-P</tt>
<br>
Parse and constraint check, as for the <tt>-p</tt>, and then print out the
resulting abstract syntax tree. Note that the print out will occur even if there
are constraint violations.
<p>
<tt>-v</tt>
<br>
Sets verbose mode, in which status messages are printed about parsing and other
processing steps leading up to execution.

<h2>Sample Code</h2>
<p>
The archive <tt>tests-x.zip</tt> unzips into a directory containing a set of simple 
execution tests. These can be run with a command of the following form
<p>
<tt>alf -m tests-x <em>testUnitName</em></tt>
<p>
Replace <tt>tests-x</tt> with the complete path to the directory, as
necessary. To run with trace output, use either the <tt>-d INFO</tt> or 
<tt>-d DEBUG</tt> option.
<p>
Note that the <tt><em>testUnitName</em></tt> is the same as the file
name, but without the <tt>.alf</tt> extension. I.e., the file 
<tt>Expressions_Assignment.alf</tt> contains the unit named
<tt>Expressions_Assignment</tt>. However, the units <tt>AssertTrue</tt>, 
<tt>AssertFalse</tt>, <tt>AssertList</tt> and <tt>Write</tt> are helper
activities, not tests, and are not individually executable.
