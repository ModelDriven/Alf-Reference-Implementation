     * 1. A select or reject expression is mapped as a sequence expansion
     * expression. The expansion region from this mapping has an output
     * expansion node of the same type as the primary expression of the sequence
     * expansion expression. This node is the result source element for the
     * overall sequence expansion expression.
     * 
     * 2. The result source element of the mapping of the argument expression is
     * the source of the decision input flow for a decision node inside the
     * expansion region. The decision node also has an incoming object flow from
     * the expansion variable fork node and an outgoing object flow to the
     * output expansion node. For a select operation, the guard on the outgoing
     * object flow is true. For a reject operation, it is false.
