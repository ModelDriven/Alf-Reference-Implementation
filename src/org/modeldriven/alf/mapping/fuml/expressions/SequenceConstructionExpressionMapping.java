    /**
     * Collection Object Creation Expression
     * 
     * 1. A sequence construction expression that does not have multiplicity is
     * mapped as an instance creation expression with a constructor for the
     * collection class given by the type name. The argument expression for the
     * constructor is mapped as below for a sequence construction expression
     * with multiplicity for the argument type of the collection class and the
     * sequence elements from the original expression.
     * 
     * Sequence Element List
     * 
     * 2. A sequence construction expression that has multiplicity and a
     * sequence list expression with a nonempty expression list is mapped to a
     * structured activity node with a single output pin whose type and
     * multiplicity, are as specified for the expression. The output pin is the
     * result source element for the expression.
     * 
     * 3. Each element expression is mapped inside the structured activity node,
     * with an object flow from its result source element to the structured
     * activity node output pin. If there is more than one element expression,
     * then the mapping for each element expression is wrapped in its own
     * structured activity node and they are connected sequentially by control
     * flows.
     * 
     * Sequence Range
     * 
     * 4. A sequence construction expression that has multiplicity and a
     * sequence range expression is mapped to a structured activity node with
     * the range upper and lower expressions mapped inside it. The result source
     * elements of the upper and lower expressions are connected by object flows
     * to input pins of a loop node in the structured activity node. The loop
     * node also has a third input pin that has a multiplicity lower bound of 0.
     * The output pin corresponding to this third input pin is the result source
     * element for the sequence range expression
     * 
     * 5. The loop node is iterative, continually incrementing the value in its
     * first loop variable until it reaches the value of its second loop
     * variable. On each iteration, it appends the value of its first loop
     * variable to the list in its third loop variable, which, at the end of the
     * iteration, thus contains the desired sequence.
     * 
     * Empty Collections
     * 
     * 6. A sequence construction expression that has multiplicity and an empty
     * expression list maps to a value specification action for a literal null.
     * The result output pin of the value specification has the type given for
     * the sequence list expression and the multiplicity [1..1]. It is the
     * result source element for the expression.
     * 
     * 7. The keyword null is mapped as any[]{}.
