A performance credit is a particular menion ("credit") of a performer or
contributor to a recording. Generally, several different people are listed on
each recording; not just the principal performer(s), but also the director,
producer, etc. The performance credit is not intended to be a complete listing
of all of the credits on a recording, just enough to provide a way to look up
the most popular performers on a recording.
